# Finding Tilly - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

Finding Tilly is an educational web game designed for children ages 3-10 that combines storytelling with educational puzzles. The game revolves around finding a hidden cat named Tilly by navigating through different locations and solving age-appropriate puzzles related to alphabet recognition, number sequences, and basic addition.

## Educational Goals

1. **Literacy Development**: Improve alphabet recognition and sequencing skills
2. **Numeracy Development**: Enhance number recognition, counting, and basic arithmetic
3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Develop logical thinking and pattern recognition
4. **Digital Literacy**: Introduce children to interactive digital learning experiences
5. **Engagement**: Create a fun, rewarding experience that motivates learning

## Target Audience

The game is designed for children ages 3-10, with three distinct skill levels:

1. **Explorer (Ages 3-4)**: Preschoolers beginning to learn letters and numbers
2. **Adventurer (Ages 5-6)**: Kindergarteners with basic literacy and numeracy skills
3. **Champion (Ages 7-10)**: Elementary students ready for more complex challenges

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

Finding Tilly is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application follows a component-based architecture, with each UI element encapsulated in its own component.

#### Key Technologies

- **React.js**: Core UI library
- **React Router**: For navigation between screens
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations
- **Firebase** (optional): For authentication and data storage

#### State Management

The application uses React Context API for state management, with two main contexts:

1. **GameContext**: Manages all game-related state
2. **AuthContext**: Handles user authentication and profile management

This approach allows for efficient state sharing across components without prop drilling, while maintaining a clean component structure.

### Component Structure

The application is organized into the following key components:

1. **App**: The root component that sets up routing and context providers
2. **WelcomeScreen**: Initial screen for player name input and skill level selection
3. **GameScreen**: Main game interface that coordinates location display and puzzles
4. **LocationDisplay**: Visual representation of the current location
5. **PuzzleDisplay**: Interactive puzzle interface with answer options
6. **WinScreen**: Celebration screen when Tilly is found
7. **LeaderboardScreen**: Display of top players and achievements

### Data Flow

1. Player information and game settings are collected in the WelcomeScreen
2. This data is stored in GameContext and persists throughout the game session
3. As players navigate between locations, the GameScreen updates the current location in GameContext
4. PuzzleDisplay fetches puzzles based on the current location and skill level
5. When puzzles are solved, progress is updated in GameContext
6. When win conditions are met, the player is redirected to the WinScreen

## Game Mechanics

### Navigation System

Players navigate through different locations by selecting from available exits. Each location has:

- A unique name and description
- A visual representation
- A specific puzzle type (alphabet, numbers, or addition)
- Connected exits to other locations

### Puzzle System

Puzzles are dynamically generated based on:

1. **Location**: Each location has a specific puzzle type
2. **Skill Level**: Difficulty adapts to the selected skill level
3. **Progress**: Puzzles avoid repetition by tracking previously used questions

Each puzzle includes:

- A question (e.g., "What letter comes after P?")
- Multiple choice answers
- Optional visual aids for additional support

### Progress Tracking

The game tracks:

- Number of puzzles solved
- Consecutive correct answers (streak)
- Hints used
- Total moves made
- Time taken to complete the game

### Reward System

To maintain engagement, the game includes:

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Visual and audio feedback for correct/incorrect answers
2. **Streak Counter**: Recognition for consecutive correct answers
3. **Bonus Questions**: Extra challenges for quick learners
4. **Celebration Effects**: Confetti and animations when Tilly is found
5. **Printable Certificate**: Personalized achievement certificate

## Educational Design Principles

### Scaffolded Learning

The game implements scaffolded learning through:

1. **Skill Levels**: Content difficulty adapts to the child's age and ability
2. **Visual Aids**: Optional helpers that can be shown/hidden as needed
3. **Hint System**: Additional support when children struggle with puzzles

### Multimodal Learning

The game supports different learning styles through:

1. **Visual Learning**: Images, animations, and visual representations
2. **Interactive Learning**: Hands-on puzzle solving and navigation
3. **Textual Learning**: Written questions and instructions

### Positive Reinforcement

The game uses positive reinforcement through:

1. **Encouraging Feedback**: Supportive messages for both correct and incorrect answers
2. **Progressive Challenges**: Gradually increasing difficulty based on success
3. **Celebration of Achievements**: Special effects and rewards for accomplishments

## Implementation Details

### Puzzle Generation

Puzzles are generated from a library of questions organized by:

1. **Type**: Alphabet, numbers, or addition
2. **Difficulty**: Explorer, adventurer, or champion level
3. **Format**: Question structure and answer options

The `gameService.js` file handles puzzle selection, ensuring appropriate difficulty and preventing repetition.

### Location Management

Locations are defined in the GameContext with:

1. **Name**: Identifier for the location
2. **Description**: Text description of the location
3. **PuzzleType**: The type of puzzle associated with the location
4. **Exits**: Array of connected locations

### Progress Management

Game progress is tracked in the GameContext state:

1. **puzzlesSolved**: Counter for completed puzzles
2. **moves**: Counter for navigation actions
3. **hintsUsed**: Counter for hint button usage
4. **streak**: Counter for consecutive correct answers

### Win Condition

The primary win condition is solving 5 puzzles, which triggers:

1. Redirection to the WinScreen
2. Display of game statistics
3. Celebration effects
4. Option to view/print a certificate

## User Experience Considerations

### Child-Friendly Interface

The interface is designed specifically for children with:

1. **Large, Clear Buttons**: Easy to click for developing motor skills
2. **Simple Navigation**: Intuitive movement between locations
3. **Bright Colors**: Engaging visual palette
4. **Emoji-Based Visuals**: Familiar and friendly imagery
5. **Minimal Text**: Reduced reading requirements for younger players

### Accessibility

The game implements accessibility features:

1. **Color Contrast**: Ensuring text is readable
2. **Simple Language**: Age-appropriate instructions
3. **Visual Aids**: Support for different learning needs
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Alternative to mouse interaction

### Responsive Design

The interface adapts to different screen sizes:

1. **Mobile-Friendly Layout**: Reorganizes for smaller screens
2. **Touch-Optimized Controls**: Suitable for tablets and touchscreens
3. **Flexible Component Sizing**: Adjusts to available space
